	<h1>Tile Project</h1>

	<p>I started reading Robert Bosch book "Opt Art: From Mathematical Optimization to Visual Design"
	and wanted to play a little bit with some of the concepts related with the first chapter, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truchet_tiles">The Truchet Tiles</a>.
	Meanwhile I was working in this I made a little image processing stuff with p5.js using the tile concepts and
	the mesuarement of brightness pixels to make it visible.
	</p>

	<h2>Instructions, use, whatever</h2>
	<p>Its really easy to use, you just need to upload a picture, select the size of the tile and the order of them
	then you can right click the image and save it.
	</p>

	<h3>Discccccclaimer</h3>
	<p>Im still trying to figuring out how to resize the pictures properly because theres a kind of process/time/performance issue
	if the image is big and that. The default size is the width and height of the picture multiplied by *8 if is horizontal and vertical.
	If someone knows a better way to make this a good size, tell me please. I will add it.
